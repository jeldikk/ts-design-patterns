/**
 * Iterator pattern allows sequential access to elements in a collections.

 * It provides a way to access the elements of a aggregate object

/**
 * Iterators can be used to simplify the code that iterates over a collection.
 *
 * Specifications are simple, the collection storing object should also have
 * position: specifying at what position of array it is pointing to
 *
 * next(): returning the next element in the collection
 * hasNext(): boolean, saying if there is any next element in collection.
