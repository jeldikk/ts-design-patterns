## Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are resposible for efficient communication and the assignment of responsibilities among objects.
They focus on how objects interact and communicate with each other as well as how the flow of control is organized within a system.

These pattern define the protocols for communication between objects and help in distributing responsibilities to ensure the system is efficient, maintainable and scalable.

- **Observer Pattern:** Defines one-to-many dependency between objects  
- **Iterator Pattern:** Provides a way to access eleements of an aggregate object sequentially
- **Strategy Pattern:** Encapsulates interchangeable algorithms
- **Template Method Pattern:** Defines the skeleton of an algorithm and allows subclasses to override specific steps
- **Command Pattern:** Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for request decoupling
- **State Pattern:** Allows an object to alter its behavior based on its internal state.
