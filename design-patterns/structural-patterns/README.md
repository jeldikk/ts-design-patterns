## Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns are a type of design patterns that deal with object composition of different classes that participate in the structure. This makes system more flexible and easier to maintain.


Some of the Structural Design Patterns include:

- **Adapter Pattern :**  Allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Bridge Pattern :** Decouples an abstraction from its implementation
- **Composite Pattern :** Defines a group of object treated as a single object
- **Decorator Pattern :** Adds new functionality to an existing object wihtout altering its structure
- **Facade Pattern :** Provides a simplified interface to a complex system
