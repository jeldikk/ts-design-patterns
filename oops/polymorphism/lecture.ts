/**
 * Polymorphism enabled a single interface or method to work with
 * different types of data, providing flexibility and reusability in the code.
 * The three main types of polymorphism in OOP are:
 * 1. Subtype polymorphism
 * 2. Parametric Polymorphism
 * 3. Adhoc Polymorphism
 */

/**
 * The Example we had in abstraction section is
 * a good example for subtype polymorphism. where the object we instantiated from a class
 * will behave or mimicked as another object.
 */

/**
 * Parametric polymorphism, is similar to our Generics in typescript
 * We can have a generic function or a generic class
 * Depending upon the parameter
